# IntelliJ-Plugin-Spotify

A simple plugin for IntelliJ that allows you to listen to Spotify music control it and other features.

## Spotify API Usage
This Plugin uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to interact with your Spotify account. Therefore I used the [Spotify Java wrapper/client](https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java) which is [officially supported by Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/).

## Warning
To use this plugin, you need to have a Spotify account and sign up for a developer account. You can sign up for a developer account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

Please note that your password and other personal information will only be Base64 encoded and stored in the plugin. This means that your personal information will be visible to anyone who has access to the plugin.
Dont share your personal information with anyone!
